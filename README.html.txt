This project is about an app which helps students control their living habits. The purpose of this program is to provide a service that can help improve the 
quality of life of the students or anyone that wants to use it. This program allows its premium users to create different activities for themselves, to save
those activities, to read some fun facts about health, to read some tips to improve their health, to write and read their own thoughts anytime, to create and 
save different alarms in case they need to remember to do something, and finally, they can see the superficial information of other users and sort it as they
please or search for an specific aspect.


We used every tool that was taught in the course. The .zip file contains all of the source code,
all of the documentation, the tests, images that were used in the GUI, the Javadoc with all of the contracts for the model classes, and a folder with the data
used and saved. 

The documentation includes:
- One word document with the tests design. 
- One excel document with the requirements and trace table.
- Two images (classes and objects diagrams).

This project is Java based, for this reason, some part of the documentation can only be applied and implemented using Java.

*************IMPORTANT****************
This program only works on premium accounts due to the fact that the free version is on testing still.

For this reason, if you create a free account or a normal account, you won't be able to use the program 
and you will have to create a new account.

PLEASE, if you want to use this program, create a premium account.
